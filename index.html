            <!-- Experience and Highlights -->
            <p>The experience from the trip was so amazing. I felt so relieved and relaxed, as if I had removed a burden off my shoulders.</p>

            <p>Some few highlights of the trip were :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I got to attend a cultural ceremony of one of the communities.</li>
                <li>I got to try Surfing for the very first time.</li>
                <li>I got to view the beauty of a sunset from the shore.</li>
            </ul>
